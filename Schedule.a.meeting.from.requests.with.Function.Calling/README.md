# Calendar Scheduling API

A production-oriented FastAPI service for converting natural-language meeting requests into structured Google Calendar events. The application authenticates users with Google OAuth, parses scheduling intent with an LLM, schedules background work with Celery, and publishes task progress over WebSockets.

This project is designed for use cases where a user says something like:

- "Schedule a 30-minute design review for tomorrow at 3 PM with jane@example.com"
- "Book a customer call next Tuesday at 9:30 AM with bob@company.com and alice@company.com"
- "Create a weekly sync every Friday at 11:00 AM"

The service translates that request into a validated function-call schema, tracks usage and cost, creates the event in Google Calendar with Meet, and returns progress information while the job is running.

## What this project is

This is not just a simple API wrapper around Google Calendar. It is a complete scheduling workflow with:

- Google OAuth-based authentication and token persistence
- LLM-driven extraction of calendar intent from plain text
- Structured output validation using Pydantic schemas
- Background task execution via Celery and Redis
- Rate-limiting and token-budget enforcement
- Real-time task status updates over WebSockets
- Usage tracking and admin analytics for LLM requests
- Dead-letter handling for failed or retryable background jobs
- Redis caching for repeated prompt extraction

At a high level, the system turns user intent into a scheduled calendar event and stores operational metadata so production operators can monitor reliability, cost, and failures.

## Project architecture

The codebase follows a layered architecture with separate concerns for API routes, configuration, persistence, business services, and async background processing.

### Request lifecycle

1. User signs in via Google OAuth (`/auth/login` -> `/auth/callback`)
2. A scheduling request is submitted to `POST /api/v1/async-schedule`
3. The service checks rate limits using a Redis-backed dual-bucket limiter
4. A Celery background task is created and assigned a task ID
5. The worker parses the request with the LLM engine and validates it to a schema
6. The system stores usage metadata and publishes progress events
7. Google Calendar API creates the event and optionally attaches Meet
8. Results and task status are returned through polling or WebSocket events

### Core components

- `FastAPI`: public HTTP API and auth flow
- `Celery`: background execution of long-running scheduling tasks
- `Redis`: rate limits, caching, Celery broker/backend, token quotas
- `PostgreSQL`: user records, OAuth tokens, usage logs, calendar event records
- `Google OAuth + Calendar API`: user identity and event creation
- `LLM engine`: structured extraction via Gemini/OpenRouter and schema validation
- `WebSocket event stream`: realtime status updates for UI clients

## What the app does

The service is focused on a single, practical outcome: scheduling meetings from natural language.

## Project setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ recommended
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- Redis and PostgreSQL (or Docker Compose)
- Google Cloud OAuth credentials
- A valid Google Gemini API key and/or OpenRouter API key

### 1. Clone and create environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
python -m venv env
# Windows PowerShell

LLM__GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
LLM__OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"
```

> Note: the app uses nested settings via `__` env separators. Keep the names aligned with `config/settings.py`.

### 3. Start infrastructure

This project includes a Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL and Redis:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

### 4. Start the API

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 5. Start the Celery worker

```bash
celery -A celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -Q calendar
```

If you are using the included `docker-compose.yaml`, the `web` and `celery_worker` services are preconfigured to run together.

## How to use this project

### Authentication

The project uses Google OAuth. Start the flow with:

```http
GET /auth/login
```

This redirects users to Google for consent. The callback is handled at:

```http
GET /auth/callback?code=...&state=...
```

After successful authentication, the user session is stored and the Google tokens are persisted in the database.

### Submit a meeting request

Request a background scheduling task:

```http
POST /api/v1/async-schedule
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example payload:

```json
{
  "request_text": "Schedule a 30-minute product sync tomorrow at 3 PM with alex@example.com and priya@example.com"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "task_id": "3d1c7c7b-6d7e-4f5a-bf1d-f7af6acdc198",
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

### Check task status

```http
GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}
```

Possible task states include `PENDING`, `STARTED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, and other Celery lifecycle states.

### Real-time task progress

The app exposes a websocket endpoint for service events. This is useful for progress bars and dashboards:

```text
/ws/events/{task_id}
```

The task emits structured lifecycle events such as:

- `TASK_STARTED`
- `LLM_STARTED`
- `LLM_COMPLETED`
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_STARTED`
- `TASK_COMPLETED`
- `TASK_FAILED_DB_ERROR`
- `TASK_DEAD_LETTER`

### Parse a scheduling request without queuing a task

This endpoint can extract the function-call representation from a request directly:

```http
POST /api/v1/parse-event
```

This is useful for validating LLM behavior and caching structured extraction results.

### Admin analytics

Operational insights are available through:

```http
GET /api/v1/admin/llm-analytics
```

This aggregates prompt/completion cost, cache hit rate, provider usage, and latency information.

## Runtime design notes

### Rate limiting

The app uses two safety layers:

- HTTP-level rate limiting via `slowapi`
- Redis-backed token bucket consumption at scheduling time

This protects both the public API and the underlying LLM / Google Calendar costs.

### Task execution model

Calendar scheduling is intentionally asynchronous. Execution is offloaded to a Celery worker so the API remains responsive and can safely handle long-running jobs and retries.

### Dead letter queue

Transient errors are retried; permanent or unresolved failures are pushed to the DLQ and can be inspected via the admin DLQ routes.

### Caching

Repeated scheduling requests can be cached for function-call extraction and repeated processing. This reduces repeated LLM calls and helps control cost.

## Recommended production hardening

This project is a strong foundation, but production deployment should include:

- ✅ TLS termination and secure cookie/session configuration
- ✅ Secrets managed through a proper secret store (e.g. environment injection, Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) via config-managed secure values and admin auth hardening
- ✅ Strict CORS policy and explicit trusted origins
- CI/CD pipeline with linting, security scanning, and unit/integration tests (recommended next step for branch protection)
- ✅ DB migrations and rollback strategy for schema changes
- ✅ Monitoring, alerting, and log aggregation for Celery workers and web app
- ✅ User tenancy or multi-tenant isolation for production deployments
- ✅ Additional retry policies and backoff tuning for Google API calls
- ✅ Storage of OAuth refresh/write tokens in a hardened secret store
- ✅ Redis-backed adaptive dynamic throttling to reduce refill rates during provider degradation
- ✅ DLQ admin replay/dry-run safety controls with idempotency, locks, HMAC auditing, and quarantine
- ✅ Timezone-aware ISO wall-clock context to prevent DST-related scheduling drift
- ✅ OAuth token rotation with Redis grace-period serving and token-family revocation

## TODO / roadmap

- Add unit and integration tests for routes, Celery tasks, and schema validation
- ✅ Add API versioning documentation and OpenAPI examples for production clients
- ✅ Improve error taxonomy for transient vs permanent scheduling failures
- ✅ Add a true admin dashboard for task health and DLQ events
- ✅ Add background health checks for Redis, Postgres, Google APIs, and Celery workers
- ✅ Add structured observability with correlation IDs and per-request tracing
- ✅ Add user-level quotas and tenant-based authorization controls
- ✅ Add event recurrence support and broader calendar editing workflows
- ✅ Add idempotency keys for scheduling requests to avoid duplicate meeting creation
- ✅ Add webhook or callback support for external systems
- ✅ Add migrations/seed scripts for easier local setup and staging deployment
- ✅ Add timezone-aware scheduling prompts and DST-safe wall-clock normalization
- ✅ Add safe DLQ replay, quarantine, and audit controls
- ✅ Add dynamic throttle reduction using Redis multiplier state
- ✅ Add OAuth token rotation with Redis grace-window and token-family quarantine
